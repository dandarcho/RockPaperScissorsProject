# The "Rock - Paper - Scissors" Game
This is a simple console game "Rock Paper Sccissors".

"Rock paper scissors" is a well know game where 2 players choose between rock, paper or scissors.
Here is a table with the possible moves:

I've used a simple console reading methods to get the move from the player and for the move by the computers I've used  the (Random) class in Java.

The move goes through some "if" statements.
The game ends when the console say of you've won, lost or the game is draw. 

The code is written on Java (IntelliJ IDEA).
